# Nik Gilmore - Software Engineer, Musician, Professional Hobbyist

Hi. I'm Nik. I'm software engineer in Seattle, Washington with 14+ years experience leading engineering teams to build cloud data applications at USAA, Amazon, Zillow, and others. My preferred stack is Rust backend, and TypeScript/React frontend. I also have a lot of professional experience with Python and Java.

## Open Source Work

* I am in the slow-moving process of cleaning up and releasing a curated set of my past software projects. 
* I am mid-development of a new Rust web and data framework, which I plan to make available under the MIT license once I reach my first release milestone later this year. [Email me](mailto:nwakg@pm.me) if you would like to join the Alpha developer preview.

### Following My Work

* If you would like to follow my work, you can follow me here (on GitHub), or [send me an email](mailto:nwakg@pm.me) to be added to the informal email list.

## Tech Interviews

I've been on both sides of the interviewing table more times than I can count. I offer affordable interview coaching to help other software engineers navigate the rigor of the long technical and behavioral interview loops. [Email me](mailto:nwakg@pm.me) if you are currently interviewing, or about to begin your search, and I am more than happy to help you land your dream job!

## Employment / Consulting

If you are hiring as a recruiter or business, please reach out by [email](nwakg@pm.me) with details about the position to request a copy of my resume.

## Music

I compose, perform, and produce music as a hobby. My latest project is called The Anklebiters, a "Dog Rock" band made up of my three small dogs Teddy, Skittles, and Jake. [Listen on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1VXDcC1RAQVwzoFAhHBZio)
