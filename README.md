# Nik Gilmore - Software Engineer, Musician, Professional Hobbyist

Hi. I'm Nik. I'm software engineer in Seattle, Washington with 14+ years experience leading engineering teams to build distributed data applications at USAA, Amazon, Zillow, and others. My preferred stack is **Rust** backend, and **TypeScript**/**React** frontend. I also have a lot of professional experience with **Python** and **Java**.

I'm behind the Rust web and data framework [`tailwag`](https://github.com/nikwithak/tailwag), which I released in 2024 under the MIT license. Although still very much in an experimental state, it aims to be a rapid development toolkit to quickly prototype new data applications. Starring this and other projects is one of the best zero-cost ways to support me and my development!
